      <h3>CHI Iron</h3>
      <p>The Chi not only smoothed tough-to-iron fabrics like linen and heavy cotton superbly, but it also had the most powerful steam burst. 
		Plus, just like your cell phones and tablets, this iron has a touch screen. 
		It displays precise temperature controls, and it's also easy to select the material you're ironing. 
		You can customize the length of the auto shut-off feature, so if you’re quilting or working on a lengthy project, it won’t shut off midway.</p>

    <img src="/images/vitessa.png" alt="BLACK + DECKER Vitessa Iron" style="width:100%">
      <h3>BLACK + DECKER</h3>
      <p>the Black + Decker Vitessa ICR2020  tied for first place in our wrinkle removal tests.
		We love that it has six different temperature settings, allowing for a more customized ironing experience, while its nonstick soleplate gives a smooth glide that rarely snags the edges of fabric.
		Storing this steam iron is as simple as pushing a button thanks to the retractable cord.
		It takes a little longer than others to heat up, but once it picks up steam, it’s hard to put down. </p>

    <img src="/images/extremesteampro.png" alt="CONAIR ExtremeSteam Pro Iron" style="width:100%">
      <h3>CONAIR Iron</h3>
      <p>The Conair ExtremeSteam Pro GI300 Iron has a heat-up time of less than 60 seconds, even at the max heat setting. 
		It also had top scores in our steam producing tests, so you can count on it to get your clothes wrinkle-free.
		This iron has rubber feet to help keep it stable and make it less likely to tip over. 
		The transparent water tank helps you see exactly how much water is in the reservoir. </p>

    <img src="/images/versaglide.png" alt="SUNBEAM Versa Glide Cordless/Corded Iron" style="width:100%">
      <h3> SUNBEAM </h3>
      <p>Use the Sunbeam Versa Glide to get out those pesky winkles without the hassle of the cord or use it with the cord for longer periods of steam and heat without placing it back on the base. 
		The base actually attaches to the rear of the iron. 
		It isn’t bulky and it's still very light relative to other irons we tested, even with the base attached. Plus, it’s one of the best deals around, especially for a 2-in-1 product! 
		The vertical steam function is very strong and all of the controls were intuitive and easy to use.</p>
